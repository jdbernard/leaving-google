## Migrations in Progress

* Photos (Picasa)

  *Replacement*: [Younited (by FSecure)](https://www.younited.com)  
  *Progress*: Account created with Younited, setup to pull data from Picasa, to
  sync photos and videos from my phone.  
  *Outstanding*: Remove photos from Picasa once I am comfortable Younited meets
  my needs.  

* Search

  *Replacement*: [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)  
  *Progress*: Firefox configured on `jdb-desktop` to use DDG.  
  *Outstanding*: Reconfigure mobile browsers, Chrome to use DDG.

* Android Backup/Sync

  *Replacement*: [Cyanogenmod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/)  
  *Progress*: Installed CM build on my phone. Linked CM account to phone.  
  *Outstanding*: Still using my Google account for application backup and sync.
  Need to evaluate the differences remaining.

* Music

  *Replacement*: [Subsonic](http://www.subsonic.org)  
  *Progess*: Installed Subsonic on `jdblabs01.jdb-labs.com`. It is available at
  [music.jdbernard.com](https://music.jdbernard.com)  
  *Outstanding*: Need to upload music. I might need to pay for more space on
  Rackspace to hold the music. My music library currently sits at 13GB.
  `jdblabs01.jdb-labs.com` has 17GB of free space, but I am not sure I want to
  use that as a storage space. The minimum file block of 100GB at Rackspace is
  $12/mo.

## Migrations Completed

* Maps
  
  *Replacement*: [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)  
  *Progress*: Bookmared in Firefox on `jdb-desktop`.
  [OsmAnd](http://osmand.net) installed on my phone.
